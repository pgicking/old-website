                The final project for Advanced Java, we were required to make a "feature rich" web application with an UI version of the airline tracker we were building the course of the term.

                <br><br><strong>Features</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supports multiple airlines per tab</li>
                <li>Data persistence on refresh</li>
                <li>Airport code validation</li>
                <li>Searching flights</li>
                <li>Lots of error checking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We were given free reign to be as ambitious or conservative as we wanted with the UI. It was made clear that designing UIs with GWT is very challenging and not very intuitive because everything is
                "blocks" inside of blocks. A common theme in student deigns was most of them had all the airlines and flights stored in one dynamically updating table, I found that to be too hard to read so I opted
                to have tabs for each airline to store the flights. Getting the tabs to work properly took the most hours out of all the other features combined because the table and tab would go wonky if there was no data in it.
                It was a good learning experience on how a small feature can sometimes be difficult to implement.
