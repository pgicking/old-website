                A small personal project that I pick up every once and a while, originally started as a way to learn how web APIs work and experimenting with JSON. Taking the first steps just communicating
                with Imgur via their API was a many hour process because I knew absolutely nothing. Many stack overflow pages later and I could ask for information about a hardlinked image on imgur and
                get the JSON response and store it in an object. Now the program can upload images to a specific users account (with permission) but the image is hard coded in so the next step is figure out
                how to display a explorer window to select image files from.
