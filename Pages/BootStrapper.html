                A project for STAT451, to simulate statistical bootstrapping. In statistics, bootstrapping is when you re-sample over a small population to simulate a large population. My partner and I
                were skeptical that this method could produce accurate results so we made this program as a proof-of-concept using word lengths in a long book because we knew we could record the entire
                "population" of a book using a computer. What we discovered is that with very high amount of re-sampling (100k+) you could get a surprisingly accurate estimates of attributes about the population.

                This was my first foray into paired programming and I quite enjoyed it. Its refreshing to be able to instantly sanity check your programming and bounce ideas off the person next to you while
                also being able to switch off roles. Since this project Ive had good and bad experiences with paired programming and would say that paired programming is only really great when you and your
                partner are on similar pages and experience levels.
