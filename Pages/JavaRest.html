                Another project for Advanced Java, we had to write a REST client/server interaction for the airline application we were building on all term.

            <p>
                This was my first time even hearing about REST so programming this project was a challenge figuring out how REST really is supposed to work. The biggest hurdle really is getting the
                servlet and client to play nice and pass data between the two. All the code we had written previously was just separated out into either the client or servlet but passing something like
                a search result of the flights took a long time to finally nail down. Also passing the correct http error codes back to the client became tedious, you had to check all possible pathways to get
                to a certain point in your code and making sure that all your required data is filled. It was a very eye opening experience and I hope to get more practice with it for capstone.
