            <p>These algorithms were harder to program than I thought they would be approaching them. The concepts weren't difficult but getting the finer details correct is what makes or breaks the algorithm.
                Those finer details can be difficult to catch in your code. It helped me appreciate how some algorithms can be a simple in concept but tricky in execution and vise versa.
                <br><br>
                For example selection sort is an easy algorithm in concept but was harder to implement from scratch than I first imagined, on the other hand heapsort was difficult to grasp in concept
                originally but the code wasn't as hard as it originally looked.
