                The group project I was apart of for my computer science capstone. I was on a team of 7 members and we developed the Routelandia app and backend for the Portal Project.
                The app lets you select two points on a specific highway and will calculate the travel time in the past, present and predictions in the future. The sponsor only wanted an
                android app but some of the team members are continuing on with an iOS app, which will hopefully be released in the coming months.
            </p>
            <p>The main idea behind the app was to help people decide when they should start to go home. Since traffic follows very cyclical patterns, the app will find these patterns and use them
               to predict how traffic is going to look in the future using data from the Oregon Department of Transportation.</p>

                <li>Writing the Detectors API routes</li>

                    <li>Front end could only send us coordinates and not station IDs</li>
                    <li>I helped make a database query that would grab the nearest stations and it often grabbed at least 4 stations or more per point</li>
                    <li>I wrote an algorithm that figured out which station pair was the only "legal" one from the 8+ points</li>
