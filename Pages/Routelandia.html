                The group project I was apart of for my computer science capstone. I was on a team of 7 members and we developed the Routelandia app and backend for the Portal Project.
                The app lets you select two points on a specific highway and will calculate the travel time in the past, present and predictions in the future.
            </p>
            <p>The main idea behind the app was to help people decide when they should start to go home. Since traffic follows very cyclical patterns, the app will find these patterns and use them
               to predict how traffic is going to look in the future using data from the Oregon Department of Transportation.</p>

                <strong>Personal Notes</strong>
            </div>
            <p>We were given free reign to be as ambitious or conservative as we wanted with the UI. It was made clear that designing UIs with GWT is very challenging and not very intuitive because everything is
                "blocks" inside of blocks. A common theme in student deigns was most of them had all the airlines and flights stored in one dynamically updating table, I found that to be too hard to read so I opted
                to have tabs for each airline to store the flights. Getting the tabs to work properly took the most hours out of all the other features combined because the table and tab would go wonky if there was no data in it.
                It was a good learning experience on how a small feature can sometimes be difficult to implement.
